# Getting started

The main components of Lightbend Orchestration need to be installed, or integrated into your build.

## reactive-cli: rp

First thing to do is installing the commandline application `rp` command on your development machine.

For macOS use Homebrew as follows:

```
brew install lightbend/tools/reactive-cli
```

See [CLI Installation](../cli-installation.md) for other operating systems.
