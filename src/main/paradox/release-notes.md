# Release Notes

This page tracks the components of Lightbend Orchestration. Note that `reactive-lib` is automatically included by `sbt-reactive-app`, so you do not normally
need to specify its version. However, a particular version can be used by explicitly setting the `reactiveLibVersion`
sbt setting.
